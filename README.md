# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Leveraging the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) library, it is designed to help employees manage their time effectively by adding important events to a daily planner.

## Features

- **Current Day Display**: The application displays the current day at the top of the calendar, providing users with context for their planning.

- **Time Blocks**: The scheduler includes time blocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm). Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future, aiding in quick visual processing.

- **Event Saving**: Users can click into a time block to enter an event and then save that event in local storage. This persistence allows for the closing and reopening of the scheduler without loss of data.

- **Responsive Layout**: Built with Bootstrap, the layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across various devices.

## How to Use

1. Open the Work Day Scheduler in your browser.
2. Click on a time block to enter an event.
3. Click the save button on the right side of the time block to save the event in local storage.
4. Refresh the page, and observe that the saved events persist.
